# Privacy Policy for CleanTube

**Last Updated:** 19 June 2025 

This Privacy Policy explains how the CleanTube browser extension ("we", "us", or "our") handles information. Your privacy is critically important to us.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

CleanTube is designed to function entirely on your local device.

*   **Watch Time Data (`watchTime`):** The extension records the amount of time you spend watching videos on YouTube. This data is stored **only on your local computer** using the browser's storage API. It is used exclusively to generate the daily and weekly watch-time charts on the extension's Settings page for your personal review.
*   **User Settings (`focusSettings`, `cooldownSettings`, etc.):** Your preferences for features like Focus Hours, Session Cooldown, and comment visibility are also stored **locally on your computer**. This allows the extension to remember your settings between browser sessions.

**Crucially, none of your watch time data or personal settings are ever transmitted, sent, or uploaded to any external server or third-party service. All data remains within your browser.**

## 2. Permissions Justification

CleanTube requests the following permissions to provide its features:

*   **`storage`:** This permission is required to save your settings and watch-time data on your local device, as described in Section 1.
*   **`tabs`:** This permission is used to identify and close YouTube tabs when a Focus Hour period begins or when a Session Timer expires. It is also used to check a tab's URL to apply blocking rules (e.g., for the cooldown challenge).
*   **`alarms`:** This permission allows the extension to create and manage the session timer and the periodic checks for the Focus Hours feature, ensuring they run at the correct time.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share any of your data with any third parties because we do not collect or have access to it.

## 4. Cookies and Tracking

The CleanTube extension does not use cookies or any third-party tracking scripts.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
